This is my implementation of a Red-Black Tree in C# (created without any pseudo-code!).
It took a while, but I learned a lot, and I hope to teach you as well.
I'm going to cover all of the things you need to know to fully understand a Red-Black Tree,
from the intuition of self-balancing, to the various rotations and recolorings that handle the implementation.
Things to cover:
1. Self-Balancing Intuition
2. Red-Black Tree (Basic Overview)
3. Insertion
4. Deletion
